# Academic Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## Overview
The Academic Performance Dashboard is a data visualization project developed using Power BI to analyze and present academic performance in a structured and interactive manner.  
The dashboard provides insights into overall academic results, subject-level performance, semester-wise trends, and grade distribution.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, DAX calculations, and dashboard design using real-world structured data.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze overall academic performance using CGPA
- Evaluate subject-wise performance and comparisons
- Track performance trends across semesters
- Understand grade distribution patterns
- Present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes academic records with the following fields:
- Academic Year
- Semester
- Subject Name
- Grade
- Grade Points
- Credits

Non-credit (Pass/Fail) subjects were excluded from CGPA calculations to maintain accuracy.
